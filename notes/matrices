matrices:
	* Model Matrix brings model from local space, where its vertices are relative
	to its own origin, to world space, where its vertices are relative to the
	whole world's origin.
	* View Matrix moves models to a position based on the position and angles
	of the camera viewing the world.
	* Projection Matrix moves the vertices of models based on details about the
	camera - fov, aspect ratio, etc. - to make it look realistically 3d.
